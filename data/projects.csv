1,Font Color Predictor,09/28/18,https://github.com/brian-w-projects/color_learner,1,Machine learning was used to determine best font color based on background color,This project is designed to decide which of two potential font colors is better suited for reading text against any color background. Machine learning is used to give individualized results for each user. Users answer 100 preferential questions displayed in a tkinter window and this information is used to predict future responses. Font colors may be selected or chosen randomly.,"In designing this project, I made a number of conscious decisions to keep the project as small as possible. Instead of looking for a comprehensive solution to the task, I instead wanted to focus on just how much of the task was achievable with a minimal amount of code. For example, the program generates the background colors randomly instead of systematically presenting a representative sample of the overall color palette. In fact, it is theoretically possible for the same color to be displayed twice (and for the user to pick a different answer each time). Possible extensions to this project could include addressing this issue and allowing for multi-classification instead of just two colors. Despite these purposeful limitations, the algorithm is able to achieve over 90% accuracy on the validation set.",www.google.com
